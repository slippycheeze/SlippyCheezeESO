# SlippyCheeze ESO micro-addons

**WARNING**: this is the stuff that is so small, or so niche, or whatever, that
I don't think it worth pushing to ESOUI.  so, uh, not really expecting
much interest.

In the event someone out there wants to contact me about them,
PC-EUÂ `@SlippyCheeze` is much more likely to get a response than either email or
a message here.

## Draw Weapons Automatically

When your reticle passes over a hostile enemy, draw your weapons if they
were sheathed, and nothing gets in the way.

This uses the ZOS definition of "enemy under the reticle" which can be weirdly
broad, but generally works out well enough.


## Khajiit Lockpick Notifier

A little hack on the excellent [Lockpick Notifier][LockpickNotifier] addon,
which fills out a message for group chat when you start unlocking a chest in
a dungeon and/or trial.

I wanted a bit of variety to what it said, instead of a single fixed message,
because who doesn't like a bit of light role-play now and then?

So, this swaps to a new, random, Khajiit themed comment after every lockpick
attempt, regardless of if it was announced or not.  More random than necessary,
but rare enough I don't care.

## Personal Assistant and AutoResearch

Integrates these two addons, so that AutoResearch doesn't fight over the
crafting station with Personal Assistant doing automatic deconstruction, etc.

Written before PA had auto-research features, but kept becuase it PA isn't going
to add the same sort of priority ordering that AR offers, and I /do/ want to
research traits in priority order while I build back up my crafter on
a new server.
